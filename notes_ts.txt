In regression, the coefficients do not chnage when we shuffle the data

In time series modelling the sequencing of the numbers is very important and has a significant effect.

The causal relationship response and explaintory variables is not significant.

Temporal dependence - dependency based on time


Time series variation = Trend + seasonal + Random
Fourth factor is cyclical which is not considered in time series modelling

1. Search for the missing values

Methods for dealing with the missing values
a. Repalce the value with the previous/ next value
b. Repalce the value with the avg of previous and next value (linear imputation)

These work well when there is a trend but no or little seasonal variation

c. To replace the missing values, take an average of all the values which are available (Mean imputation)

d. Seaonal + linear imputation - trend as well as seasonal variation is significant.

If Sept 2020 is missing. Avg of Sept 2019 and Sept 2021 will be taken as the value for missing entry.


2. Identify the outliers

3. Different models for making predictions

a. Naive method
For predicting the value for nth time interval, the value of the (n-1)th interval will be considered.

b. Averaging models
(i) Simple average - 
(ii) Moving average
(iii) Weighted moving average

c. Exponential smoothing
alpha is a parameter for which we choose a value between 0 and 1

F(t+1) = alpha * actual(t) + (1-alpha) * forecasted(t)
F(11) = alpha * actual (10) + (1-alpha) * forecasted (10)

alpha close to 1 indicates that more weightage or preference is given to the actual values


differencing of time series
corrleation between the lags

differencing is used to make a time series stationary.
Stationary time series is the one which has a mean value which is constant over a period of time. Variations are within a specific band.

A: 3,5,8,11,10
B: 2,3,3,1

List B is List A after the first level of differencing
